# Netflix Data Visualization with D3.js
## üìå Project Objective
This project aims to provide a comprehensive and interactive visualization of Netflix data using **D3.js**, a powerful JavaScript library for data-driven document manipulation. By leveraging Netflix's publicly available dataset, we explore key insights about the platform's content library, including its distribution across genres, release trends, and user ratings.

## üìÇ Data Source
The data used for this project was sourced from Kaggle:  
[Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)  
This dataset includes information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix, such as their titles, genres, release year, duration, and content ratings.

## üìä Main Visualizations
1. **World Map**: A geographical representation of Netflix's content distribution across different countries.
2. **Bar Chart - Distribution of Movies and TV Shows**: Highlights the proportion of movies and TV shows available on Netflix.
3. **Horizontal Bar Chart - Genre Distribution**: Displays the distribution of Netflix content by genre.
4. **Line Chart - Release Year vs. Content Type**: Tracks the trend of content production over the years for both movies and TV shows.
5. **Bar Chart - Content Rating Analysis**: Analyzes the frequency of various content ratings (e.g., TV-MA, PG-13).
6. **Top 10 Longest Titles by Duration**: Highlights the longest movies or shows available on the platform.

This project was developed by **Hicham RKIBA**, and **Youssef MOUSSAOUI** as part of a Data Visualization course for the **Master‚Äôs program in Data Science (M2)** at Universit√© Lyon 1.
